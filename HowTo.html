    <h2> Skills </h2>
    <h4> While I am not proficient in it to be able to design a game, I am interested in the design of games, specfifically RPGS, 
        and can teach someone how they could analyze the design of those types of games.</h4>
    <h3> How to Analyze Game Design</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Think on what the developers want the player to feel</li>
            <li> Ask why certain design choices were made (Enemy placement, weapon skills, etc)</li>
            <li> If there was one thing you could change about a game's design, what would it be any why? Ask how it would impact the game.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind the target audience </li>
        </ul>
    <h3> These are all aspects I subconciously think about when playing a game, and links to my hopes of designing a game one day</h3>
