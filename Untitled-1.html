        <p> I am interested in Computer Science and Programming.</p>

        <p> I am a bit stubborn </p>

        <p> Goal is to get into NYU or any good CS College </p>

        <p> Still learning my ways around coding!</p>
        <br>
        <p> My interest in HTML began when I started to research web development. I was unsure of what I wanted to do in the future, so I looked at how websites were designed.
        It was after looking at HMTL that I figured that I might have an interest for web development. It seemed easy enough to wrap my head around compared to Javascript, and the results were immediate.
        While HTML is much harder than I anticipated years ago, it is still really fun to learn. I hope my skills will keep on improving.

        <p> I live with my mom and dad. I recently moved to a bigger home, so that has been exciting for me. Readjusting to a new situation is tough, but just like coding, it can be done. I don't have any pets, but that's okay.    
        I have my computer to pass the time. I won't say my favorites now, thats for later.</p>
